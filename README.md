# GoogleCSEScrapper
Scrape Google Custom Search results with spelling correction and rich snippets

**GoogleCSEScrapper** is a scrapper for scrapping Google Custom Search results. Beside scrapping the search results it can even go deep and grab the spelling correction and rich snippet data. Currently it supports fetching Web and Image results.

Although I wouldn't recommend using it on Production but it can do it's job pretty well on medium/heavy requests unless you get your server IP banned by Google. But hey, Google's been a real jerk lately with their YouTube Data API v3. It's the least we can do, so lets fack on Google.

### Install via Composer

```shell
composer require mirazmac/google-cse-scrapper
```
